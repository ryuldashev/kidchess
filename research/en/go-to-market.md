## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Low Free-to-Paid Conversion (< 3%)

**Probability:** Medium (40%)

**Impact:** High — breaks unit economics

**Indicators:**
- After 500 users < 15 premium
- High paywall impressions but low clicks
- High drop-off on payment page

**Mitigation:**

| Tactic | Description | Timeline |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Improve paywall timing | A/B test: after 10 vs 20 vs 30 puzzles | Week 3-4 |
| Value communication | Show child progress before paywall | Week 4 |
| Social proof | Testimonials on paywall screen | Week 5 |
| Pricing experiments | Test $2.99 vs $3.99 vs $4.99 | Week 6-8 |
| Lifetime option | Add $29.99 lifetime | Week 8 |

**Plan B:** If < 3% after 2 months → reconsider pricing or business model (ad-supported?)

---

### Risk 2: High CAC (> $40)

**Probability:** Medium (35%)

**Impact:** High — kills scalability

**Indicators:**
- Telegram ads > $30 CAC
- Instagram influencers > $40 CAC
- Paid ads > $50 CAC

**Mitigation:**

| Tactic | Description | Timeline |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Creative refresh | New content formats, A/B tests | Ongoing |
| Narrow targeting | Focus on lookalike audiences | Week 6+ |
| Double down organic | Affiliate, SEO, communities | Ongoing |
| Referral program | Virality reduces CAC | Week 8 |

**Plan B:** If organic channels work, kill paid ads and scale coach partnerships.

---

### Risk 3: Competitors Copy AI Features

**Probability:** Medium-High (50% within 12 months)

**Impact:** Medium — lose differentiator

**Indicators:**
- ChessKid announces AI features
- Duolingo Chess adds personalization
- New startups with AI

**Mitigation:**

| Tactic | Description | Timeline |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Build brand | Become "trusted name" for toddlers | Ongoing |
| Network effects | Family mode, progress with friends | M6+ |
| Data moat | Unique learning data for 3-5 age | M3+ |
| Quality execution | Best UX, warmest hints | Ongoing |

**Plan B:** Pivot to family/social chess app (unique positioning).

---

### Risk 4: Low Retention (< 20% D7)

**Probability:** Low-Medium (30%)

**Impact:** High — high churn kills LTV

**Indicators:**
- Users open 1-2 times and leave
- Few repeat sessions
- Low puzzle solve count

**Mitigation:**

| Tactic | Description | Timeline |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Push notifications | Gentle reminders "🦊 misses you!" | Week 2 |
| Streak mechanics | "Solve 3 days in a row → get badge" | Week 4 |
| Weekly challenges | New puzzle every week | Week 6 |
| Parent dashboards | Weekly email with progress | Week 8 |

**Plan B:** Deep user interviews to understand churn reasons, rapid iteration.

### Risk 5: Duolingo Chess Expands to Younger Age

**Probability:** Medium (40% in 2026)

**Impact:** High — strong brand could take market

**Indicators:**
- Duolingo announces content for 3-6 years
- Massive marketing campaign
- Free model with huge user base

**Mitigation:**

| Tactic | Description | Timeline |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Speed to market | Capture 3-5 niche BEFORE their expansion | Immediate |
| Russian market | Dominate CIS where Duolingo weaker | M1-6 |
| Premium positioning | "Boutique personalized" vs "mass market" | Ongoing |
| B2B partnerships | Chess schools, kindergartens | M6+ |

**Plan B:** If Duolingo enters aggressively → pivot to premium/B2B or geographic focus (CIS where they're weaker).

### Risk 6: AI Costs Higher Than Expected

**Probability:** Low (20%)

**Impact:** Medium — compresses margin

**Indicators:**
- Claude Haiku price increases
- Users generate more prompts than expected
- AI costs > $0.50/user/month

**Mitigation:**

| Tactic | Description | Timeline |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Aggressive caching | Cache popular hints | Immediate |
| Prompt optimization | Shorter prompts, fewer tokens | Week 2 |
| Hybrid approach | Preset for simple, AI for complex | Week 4 |
| Price increase | $3.99 → $4.99 if needed | M6+ |

**Plan B:** Switch to cheaper model (Gemini Flash) or fully preset hints.
