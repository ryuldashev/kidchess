### Pricing Optimization

**Current Pricing (hypothesis):**

| Tier | Price | Value Prop | Target % |
|------|-------|------------|----------|
| Free | $0 | 5 puzzles/day, basic hints | 92-95% |
| Monthly | $3.99/mo | Unlimited, AI hints, 3 kids | 3-4% |
| Annual | $39.99/yr | Save 2 months ($47.88 value) | 1.5-2% |
| Lifetime | $49.99 | One-time, everything forever | 0.5-1% |

**A/B Testing Plan:**

**Test 1: Free tier limits**
- Variant A: 5 puzzles/day (unlimited days)
- Variant B: 20 puzzles total (then paywall)
- Variant C: 7 days full access (then paywall)
- Metric: Conversion rate, Time to convert

**Test 2: Price points**
- Variant A: $3.99/mo
- Variant B: $4.99/mo
- Variant C: $2.99/mo (with annual upsell)
- Metric: Conversion rate, ARPU, LTV

**Test 3: Trial length**
- Variant A: 7 days free trial
- Variant B: 14 days free trial
- Variant C: No trial, but 30-day money-back guarantee
- Metric: Trial→Paid conversion

**Test 4: Anchor pricing**
- Variant A: Monthly ($3.99) vs Annual ($39.99)
- Variant B: Monthly ($3.99) vs Annual ($39.99) vs Lifetime ($49.99) ← anchor
- Variant C: Monthly ($3.99) vs Lifetime ($49.99) only
- Hypothesis: Lifetime creates anchor, more choose Annual

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Find sweet spot pricing (likely $3.99-4.99)
- Optimize paywall timing (likely day 3-7)

## 🔁 Retention Strategy

### Onboarding (First 7 Days)

**Goal:** Achieve "Aha Moment" → child solves first puzzle with joy

**Day 0 (Sign-up):**
- Welcome screen: "Hi! I'm 🦊 Fox, your chess friend!"
- Quick tutorial: How to move pieces (interactive, 2 min)
- First puzzle: Super easy (checkmate in 1, with queen)
- Success celebration: Confetti, sound, "You're amazing! 🎉"
- Parent dashboard: "Here's how to track progress"

**Day 1:**
- Push notification (if allowed): "🦊 New puzzle waiting for you!"
- Email to parent: "Tips for first sessions"
- In-app: "Streak" badge (2 days in a row!)

**Day 3:**
- Push: "🔥 You have a 3-day streak! Keep going!"
- Email: "[Child name]'s progress: 8 puzzles solved!"
- In-app: Unlock new pack

**Day 7:**
- Push: "🌟 A week with KidChess! Check your progress"
- Email: "Weekly report + special Premium offer"
- In-app: "Achievement unlocked: Week Warrior"

**Metrics:**
- Day 1 return: >50%
- Day 7 return: >30%
- Day 7→Day 14: >40%

### Engagement Mechanics

**1. Streaks (Daily Activity):**
- Visual calendar with flames 🔥
- Rewards for streaks: 7 days → badge, 30 days → special puzzle pack
- Streak saver: "Missed a day? Use Streak Saver!" (1 free/month, or Premium perk)

**2. Progressive Unlock:**
- Puzzles unlock gradually (not all at once)
- "Unlock next pack by solving 10 puzzles"
- Creates anticipation, sense of progress

**3. Adaptive Difficulty:**
- AI tracks successes
- If 3 errors in a row → suggest easier puzzle
- If 10 correct in a row → "Ready for challenge!"
- Glicko-2 rating under the hood (don't show kids, but use it)

**4. Achievements & Badges:**
- "First checkmate", "10 puzzles", "Tactic Master", "Week streak"
- Collectible (show in profile)
- Shareable to social

**5. Weekly Challenges:**
- Each week — themed challenge
- "Fork week", "Defense week", etc
- Leaderboard (kids compete)
- Prize: Special badge or bonus hints

### Push Notifications Strategy

**Permission Request:**
- Not immediately on install (low conversion)
- After first solved puzzle: "Want 🦊 to remind about new puzzles?"
- Explain value: "We'll send 1 reminder per day"

**Notification Types:**

| Type | Trigger | Frequency | Example |
|------|---------|-----------|---------|
| Daily reminder | 24h since last visit | 1x/day | "🦊 New puzzle waiting for you!" |
| Streak reminder | Risk losing streak (8pm) | 1x/day | "🔥 Don't lose your streak! 4 hours left" |
| Achievement | Unlocked badge/milestone | Ad-hoc | "🌟 Congrats! 50 puzzles solved!" |
| Social | Friend activity | Max 1x/day | "Your friend Misha solved a puzzle! Show who's better 😊" |
| Re-engagement | 3 days inactive | Once | "We miss you! 🦊 Come back, new puzzles await" |
| Premium offer | Day 7, 14 (if free user) | 2-3x total | "Special offer: 50% off Premium!" |

**Best Practices:**
- Personalization: "Hi, [Name]!"
- Emoji for visual highlight
- Short & clear (50-100 characters)
- Deep link to relevant screen
- A/B test copy

**Opt-out rate target:** <5% (industry avg 10-20%)

### Email Marketing

**Cadence:**

**Week 1-4 (Onboarding sequence):**
- Day 0: Welcome email (how to start)
- Day 1: Tips for first sessions
- Day 3: Child's progress + support
- Day 7: Weekly report + Premium offer
- Day 14: "You're almost pro!" + Premium offer
- Day 30: Monthly report + success stories

**Ongoing (Active users):**
- Weekly digest: Progress, new features, tips
- Monthly report: Detailed statistics
- Ad-hoc: New puzzle packs, updates, special offers

**Re-engagement (Inactive users):**
- 7 days inactive: "We miss you!"
- 14 days: "What went wrong? (Survey)"
- 30 days: "Last chance: here's what's new"

- Months 3-4: Lean Growth ($1,500) — scale what works
- Months 5+: Aggressive ($5,000) — IF ROAS > 3

---

### ROI Calculation

**Assumptions:**
- CAC: $15 (blended average)
- Free→Paid conversion: 5%
- ARPU: $3.99/month (monthly plan)
- Retention: 70% month-over-month (paid users)
- LTV = ARPU / Churn = $3.99 / 0.30 = $13.30 (conservative)

**Cohort Analysis (100 users acquired):**

| Month | Users Acquired | Premium Users | MRR | Cumulative Spend | Cumulative Revenue | ROI |
|-------|----------------|---------------|-----|------------------|-------------------|-----|
| 1 | 100 | 5 (5%) | $20 | $1,500 | $20 | -98.7% |
| 2 | 100 | 10 (5% new + retained) | $60 | $3,000 | $80 | -97.3% |
| 3 | 100 | 17 | $120 | $4,500 | $200 | -95.6% |
| 4 | 100 | 25 | $190 | $6,000 | $510 | -91.5% |
| 5 | 100 | 33 | $270 | $7,500 | $1,020 | -86.4% |
| 6 | 100 | 42 | $360 | $9,000 | $1,740 | -80.7% |
| 12 | - | 85 | $680 | $18,000 | $6,120 | -66% |
| 18 | - | 110 | $880 | $27,000 | $12,600 | -53% |
| 24 | - | 130 | $1,040 | $36,000 | $21,720 | -40% |

**Break-even:** ~30 months (for cohort)

**BUT:** When adding new cohorts each month:

| Month | Total Premium | MRR | Cumulative Spend | Cumulative Revenue | Profit |
|-------|---------------|-----|------------------|-------------------|--------|
| 3 | 52 | $207 | $4,500 | $627 | -$3,873 |
| 6 | 168 | $670 | $9,000 | $3,420 | -$5,580 |
| 12 | 420 | $1,676 | $18,000 | $13,284 | -$4,716 |
| 18 | 680 | $2,713 | $27,000 | $31,944 | +$4,944 |
| 24 | 950 | $3,791 | $36,000 | $60,516 | +$24,516 |

**Break-even (company level):** Month 16-18

**This assumes:**
- Consistent acquisition of 100 users/month
- 5% conversion (conservative)
- 70% retention (conservative)
- No LTV improvements (upsells, annual plans)

**Optimistic Scenario (7% conversion, 75% retention, upsells):**
- Break-even: Month 12-14
- Month 24 profit: $45,000+

---

### LTV Optimization Strategies

**Current LTV: $13-15 (conservative)**

**Goal: $30-40**

**Tactics:**

**1. Increase ARPU:**
- Upsell Monthly → Annual (save 2 months!)
  - Impact: ARPU $3.99 → $3.33/month, but pay upfront ($39.99)
- Upsell to Lifetime ($49.99)
  - Impact: Immediate $50 revenue (vs $3.99 × 12 = $47.88)
- Add-ons: Extra kids ($1.99/kid), Custom puzzle packs ($4.99)

**Expected:** ARPU $3.99 → $5.50 (+38%)

**2. Improve Retention:**
- Better onboarding (reduce early churn)
  - Impact: Day 7 retention 40% → 55%
- Engagement features (streaks, achievements)
  - Impact: Monthly churn 30% → 20%
- Re-engagement campaigns (win-back)
  - Impact: 10% of churned users return

**Expected:** Monthly retention 70% → 80% (churn 30% → 20%)

**3. Referral Program:**
- Incentivize users to refer friends
- Free month for referrer + referred
- Impact: 20% of users refer 1+ friend → viral coefficient 0.2-0.3
- Lower effective CAC ($15 → $12)

**New LTV calculation:**
- ARPU: $5.50
- Churn: 20%
- LTV = $5.50 / 0.20 = $27.50

**If also reduce CAC to $12:**
- LTV/CAC = $27.50 / $12 = 2.29 (good!)
- Target: 3+ (great)
